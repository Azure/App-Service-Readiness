      [mksunitha](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/profile/mksunitha)  3/6/2017 11:00:24 PM  MySQL in-app was a preview feature [launched last year ](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/mysql-in-app-preview-app-service/)in August. The feature primary objective was to make it easier to build and test MySQL based applications on App Service. Today, I am excited to announce general availability of MySQL in-app feature. *Note : This MySQL in-app is specific to Windows version of Azure app service. If you are looking for local mysql on Linux MySQL app service , click [here.](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appserviceteam/2017/06/07/mysql-in-app-feature-for-web-apps-on-linux/)* We have rolled out a [database migration feature ](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appserviceteam/2017/03/06/migrate-development-database-on-mysql-in-app-to-production-mysql-database/)from MySQL in-app that allows you to export your database content from **localdb** database provided by MySQL in-app and import it into a production database. A **production database** can be managed MySQL service or your custom MySQL server solution. See [options](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appserviceteam/2017/03/06/announcing-general-availability-for-mysql-in-app#productionmysql) for production MySQL database in Azure. This feature will be continue to accelerate your development and testing scenarios . Here are key benefits of using this feature :  2. It supports any runtime stack that is available in App Service (Windows) applications such as Node JS , .NET , Python , PHP etc. For Python, Node JS , .NET do make sure you have the appropriate libraries or drivers with your code in order to connect to MySQL database provided with MySQL in-app
 4. It’s cost-effective since there’s no additional cost to use this feature and you only pay for the App Service plan (since resources are shared).
 6. The MySQL and Web processes are co-located in the same environment (hence the term in-app) which means storage is shared.
 8. Includes support for slow query logging and general logging, which you’ll need to turn on as needed (this feature impacts performance, so you shouldn’t use it all the time).
 10. One click migration of your database from MySQL in-app to a production MySQL database solution. Azure offers many solutions for MySQL , including: 
	 - [Azure database for MySQL(Preview)](http://azure.microsoft.com/services/mysql)
	 - Marketplace solutions for [MySQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/?term=mysql), [MariaDB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/?term=mariadb), and other MySQL-compatible solutions from partners like [Bitnami](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partners/bitnami/mysql/)and [MariaDB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partners/mariadb/cluster-maxscale/)
	 - Community-contributed [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/templates/?term=mysql+cluster+centos+-lamp+-website)deploying on VMs
	 - MySQL on virtual machine on [Linux](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-classic-mysql-on-opensuse/)or [Windows](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-classic-mysql-2008r2/) OS
	  
   If you intend to use this feature for PRODUCTION web application , your web application must meet one or more of the criteria below :  - your application is read only web site [ when file server is in read only mode , the database is read only as well ]
 - your application does not need auto scale
 - File servers may go into read only mode from 1 to 6 mins depending on whether an upgrade is occurring or any intermittent storage connectivity issue occurs. For example if you use wordpress and during this time you cannot write a post or edit content. You can retry in a few minutes and it will work. If this is okay for your production app then use MySQL inapp
 - Review your user traffic on your application and test to see if your application can run on one instance. If it can manage the load , you can use MySQL inapp for production.
  The reason for the criteria mentioned above is due to the lack of support for auto scale on App service with MySQL in-app.
