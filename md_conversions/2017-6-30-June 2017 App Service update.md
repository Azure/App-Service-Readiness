      [Byron Tardif](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/profile/Byron Tardif)  6/30/2017 3:14:58 PM  This month we shipped improvements to the overview blade, a new unified create experience for both Windows and Linux based apps as well a new recommendation history UX. New App Service Overview blade
------------------------------

 The overview blade for Web, Mobile and API apps has been overhauled with new charting controls and performance improvements, this should make browsing through your apps faster. The new charts integrate nicely with [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-get-started) and are perfect for pinning into [custom dashboards](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-dashboards).

-------------------------------------------------------------

 With this update you can now choose the OS of the App Service plan used to host your app. Learn more about [Web App on Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/app-service-linux-intro).

------------------------------------------

 [App Service Advisor](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Azure-Friday/Azure-App-Service-Advisor) provides proactive recommendations on how to solve problems with your application. We have revamped this UI to also include a history of the recommendations that have triggered in the past.
