      [Byron Tardif](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/profile/Byron Tardif)  6/4/2018 5:12:14 PM   We are happy to announce a new preview experience for setting up deployments to Azure App Service. Deployment Center is a centralized overview for all of the deployment options available to you. It also provides a guided experience to set up your deployments. With the new UX you can now **search** and **filter** through your **repositories** and **branches** making navigation through large code repositories easier. [![search]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/2018/06/search_thumb.gif "search")]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/2018/06/search.gif) We have also revamped the access to **log files** making them easier to find and consume. [![logs]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/2018/06/logs_thumb.gif "logs")]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/2018/06/logs.gif) Other improvements include:  2. Link back to ****source repository**** ([as requested in our Uservoice](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/169385/suggestions/16327096))
 4. Displaying the **branch information** ([as requested in our Uservoice](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/169385-web-apps/suggestions/15365301-show-deployment-source))
 6. Information about the **Commit ID** and **Author**
 8. Surfacing the **Check-in message**
  All of these improvements are geared to help developers understand what version of their code is currently deployed in their app. [![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/2018/06/image_thumb35.png "image")]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/2018/06/image37.png) Deployment credential management is now contextualized to your deployment provider/method of choice. It is now easier to set and re-set credentials from the deployment center without having to visit another UI or abandon the flow.

  - This preview is currently available for **Windows** hosted apps and we plan to extend this to **Linux** and **Functions** in the coming months.
 - You must be part of the **Owner role** in the subscription to use this feature, we plan to remove this limitation in future releases.
