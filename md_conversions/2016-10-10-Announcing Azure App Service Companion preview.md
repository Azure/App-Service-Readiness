      [Byron Tardif](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/profile/Byron Tardif)  10/10/2016 12:04:17 PM  **UPDATE**: Azure App Service companion is now available in the [Apple App Store for your iOS devices](https://itunes.apple.com/app/azure-app-service-companion/id1146659260)  Today when you are managing your existing [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service) assets you have two options, the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), or [Azure CLI](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/powershell-install-configure/) both of these experiences are great when used in your laptop/desktop regardless of what operating system you are using. However, neither of them are tailored for use in mobile scenarios. This is where [Azure App Service Companion](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=azureApps.AzureApps) comes into play. The goal for [Azure App Service Companion](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=azureApps.AzureApps) is to provide the basic functionality that you need when you are on the go, without requiring you to use your laptop. All in a native experience for your device. [![Get it on Google Play](https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/generic/en_badge_web_generic.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=azureApps.AzureApps) **Azure App Service Companion** allows you to:  - Monitor your App Service instances
 - View custom alerts based on site status
 - Troubleshoot sites from anywhere
