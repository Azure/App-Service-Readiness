For cosmos DB you can use binding or the SDK.*      **Azure ****SQL DB** **MySQL in-app**** ** **Azure Database for MySQL ** **Azure Database for PostgreSQL ** **Cosmos DB**   Generally available  ✓ ✓ Public Preview  Public Preview ✓   Free Database Tier ***** ✓ ✓      Managed Database as a Service ✓  ✓ ✓ ✓   Remotely access database ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓   Documentation [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/) [link](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appserviceteam/2016/08/18/announcing-mysql-in-app-preview-for-web-apps/) [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/) [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/) [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/)   Scalability ✓  ✓ ✓ ✓   Geo Replication ✓    ✓   SSL ✓  ✓ ✓ ✓   Firewall Configuration ✓  ✓ ✓ ✓   Database Sharding /Partitioning  ✓    ✓   Pricing [link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/sql-database/)  [link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/mysql/) [link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/postgresql) [link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cosmos-db/)   Region Availability  [link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/services/)   Linux Azure Web Apps ****** ✓ [link](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appserviceteam/2017/06/07/mysql-in-app-feature-for-web-apps-on-linux/) ✓ ✓ ✓   Windows Azure Web Apps ****** ✓ [link](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appserviceteam/2016/08/18/announcing-mysql-in-app-preview-for-web-apps/) ✓ ✓ ✓   App service Backup and Restore ******* ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓    Azure Mobile App ✓    ✓   Azure Functions ********  ✓  ✓ ✓  ✓
