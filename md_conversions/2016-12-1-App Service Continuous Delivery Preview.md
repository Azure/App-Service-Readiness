      [Byron Tardif](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/profile/Byron Tardif)  12/1/2016 10:00:09 AM  Continuing the partnership between **App Service** and **Visual Studio Team Services**, we have a new preview experience for setting up a continuous delivery pipeline to automate the source control, build, test and deployment of your solutions to **App Service**. The new experience is accessible through the settings menu under **App Deployment** > **Continuous Delivery (Preview)** [![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/2016/11/image_thumb723.png "image")]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/2016/11/image851.png) Some of the highlights features include:  - Ability to host your code in **GitHub** or **Visual Studio Team Services**
 - Ability to **create**, **deploy** and **execute** load tests against an **independent** App Service plan.
 - Deployment directly to **deploymetn slots** following App Service deployment best practices.
