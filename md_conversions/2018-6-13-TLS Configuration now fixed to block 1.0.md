      [Oded Dvoskin](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/profile/Oded Dvoskin)  6/13/2018 8:57:33 AM  We recently announced that all App Service and Functions apps could [update TLS configuration](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appserviceteam/2018/04/17/app-service-and-functions-hosted-apps-can-now-update-tls-versions/). However, after deployment, an [edge case scenario](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appserviceteam/2018/05/02/breaking-change-for-sni-ssl-hostnames-on-azure-app-service/) was identified involving SNI-SSL which led to SSL analyzing tools such as [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html), showing that TLS 1.0 was still accepted, while higher versions were selected. We have now completed the deployment which solves the issue for SSI-SSL and will also translate to the reporting tool indicating correctly that lower versions of TLS, mainly TLS 1.0, are indeed blocked.
