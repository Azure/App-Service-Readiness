You can learn more about app service quotas and how the apply to your apps here: [How to: Monitor Apps in Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/web-sites-monitor/) The new quota UX letâ€™s get an at a glance view of the quotas applicable to your app. [![clip_image001]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/2016/08/clip_image001_thumb13.png "clip_image001")]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/2016/08/clip_image00114.png) Each quota contains basic information about (1) the current utilization, (2) the limit for this specific quota, (3) when will the quota re-set and (4) the quota name. [![clip_image002]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/2016/08/clip_image002_thumb11.png "clip_image002")]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/2016/08/clip_image00211.png) You can manually refresh the view by clicking on the refresh button in the action bar or provide us feedback directly about this new UX.
