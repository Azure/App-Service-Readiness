      [Yi Liao MSFT](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/profile/Yi Liao MSFT)  5/7/2018 8:25:00 AM  Following our communication earlier in the year, the App Service team is happy to announce that the App Service Authentication/Authorization feature is now available to Linux apps.  **What’s ****App Service a****uthentication/****a****uthorization feature?**
============================================================================

 Azure App Service provides built-in authentication and authorization support, so you can sign in users and access data by writing minimal or no code in your web app. The same authentication and authorization feature support for Windows apps is now available to App Service on Linux including Web App for Containers.  [This overview article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-authentication-overview) describes how App Service helps simplify authentication and authorization for your app.  **Is the feature ****behavior**** different on Linux? **
========================================================

 No. The authentication and authorization works the same way on Linux apps as Windows.  The configuration experience on Azure portal and CLI is exactly the same, if you’re familiar with how to configure a Windows app for this feature, you’re ready to go and can do the same for a Linux app.  **I’m a Linux customer ****new to this feature, how ****do**** I configure it**** for my ****Linux ****app****?**
