      [Byron Tardif](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/profile/Byron Tardif)  8/8/2017 4:19:41 PM  Today we are releasing a new tabbed experience for Azure Functions that lets you quickly navigate between multiple features when you are configuring your application.

This new experience was [developed](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-ux/pull/1622) as part of the [Azure Functions UX](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-ux) open source project with input from Azure Functions [MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/) community.

As part of the efforts to be more customer driven we also opened this feature up in preview through [@azurefunctions](https://twitter.com/AzureFunctions/status/887067519248252929)

> â€” Azure Functions (@AzureFunctions) [July 17, 2017](https://twitter.com/AzureFunctions/status/887067519248252929)  This feature is currently enabled for **Function app settings**, and **API definition feature**. We will be adding more items to this experience in the coming months.

Features that will open in a tab have a small decorator to indicate they will open in this tabbed experience.
