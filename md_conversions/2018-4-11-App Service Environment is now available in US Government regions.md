      [Christina Compy (MSFT)](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/profile/Christina Compy (MSFT))  4/11/2018 1:37:03 PM  The App Service Environment, with Isolated pricing plans, is now available in the US Government regions. The App Service Environment is a deployment of the Azure App Service and runs in your Azure Virtual Network. With an App Service Environment you have more options for:  - High scale
 - Network isolation
 - High memory utilization
  The App Service Environment can be deployed with an internet accessible endpoint or with an endpoint on a private address in your Azure Virtual Network. This makes the App Service Environment a great solution to host your line of business applications or those applications that you want to only expose through a web application firewall such as the Azure Application Gateway.
