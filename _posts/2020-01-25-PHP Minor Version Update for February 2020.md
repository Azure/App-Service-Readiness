Latest version updates to PHP

In February 2020, Azure App Service will update the Windows PHP stacks to the latest available versions. For information on the changes in the new versions, please see the change logs on the PHP website.


PHP Version | Change Log
-- | --
7.2.27 | https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-7.php#7.2.27
7.3.14 | https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-7.php#7.3.14


Additionally, the Windows build of [PHP 7.4](https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-7.php#7.4.2) will be available with the February 2020 update.


**NOTE:** Both PHP versions 7.0 and 7.1 are past [End-Of-Life](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php), and are no longer receiving security updates from the community.  These versions will be removed with the February 2020 update.  All sites configured with either PHP 7.0 or 7.1 will have their configuration changed to **PHP 7.3**.
