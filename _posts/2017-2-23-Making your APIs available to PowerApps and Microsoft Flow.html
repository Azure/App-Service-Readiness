<div id="content">Azure App Service and Azure Functions are both commonly used for building organizational APIs. These might include important business logic needed by many apps and activities. Traditionally, most of these clients are written by professional developers, but Microsoft also offers solutions that enable anyone in an organization to build solutions.

<a href="https://powerapps.com/">PowerApps</a> and <a href="https://flow.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Flow</a> are services that enable power users within an organization to get more done. Without writing any code, users can easily create apps and custom automated workflows that interact with a variety of enterprise data and services. While they can leverage a wide variety of built-in SaaS integrations, users often find the need to incorporate company-specific business logic.

We've now extended the API Definition feature of App Service and Azure Functions to include an "Export to PowerApps and Microsoft Flow" gesture. This walks you through all the steps needed to make any API in App Service or Azure Functions available to PowerApps and Microsoft Flow users. To learn more, see our <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-export-api-to-powerapps-and-flow">documentation</a>.

We're hoping to make this experience even easier over time.
