For several years, Red Hat and Microsoft have [partnered](https://www.redhat.com/en/red-hat-microsoft-partnership) to create cloud solutions that enable enterprises to achieve more. Today, we are happy to announce that Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) is now in Public Preview on Azure App Service. App Service has supported Tomcat and Java SE applications on Linux since 2018. Since then, our customers made it clear that they wanted an equivalent service for their Jakarta EE applications.

## JBoss across Azure

Whether your organization is running a heavily customized, clustered JBoss deployment or has embraced container technologies, Azure has a cloud service to fit your needs. With Red Hat Enterprise Linux on Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS), you can easily lift-and-shift your on-prem JBoss deployments. [Azure Red Hat Openshift](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-and-microsoft-fuel-hybrid-cloud-development-azure-red-hat-openshift) combines the innovation of enterprise Kubernetes with the worldâ€™s leading enterprise Linux platform, Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

App Service gives organizations the option to leverage a managed Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for their cloud migrations. App Service provides APIs for deployment, features for network isolation, and auto scaling.

## JBoss on App Service

JBoss EAP on App Service is jointly developed and supported by Red Hat and Azure. Any support cases concerning the JBoss server will be handled by the experts at Red Hat.
