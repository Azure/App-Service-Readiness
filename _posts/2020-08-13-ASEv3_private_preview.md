The ASEv3 project is a realization of several years of infrastructure development to enable a best in class Isolated application hosting PaaS service.  The ASEv3 product has also been called the multi-network ASE. 

## ASEv3 Overview

The App Service Environment (ASE) is a single tenant instance of the Azure App Service that runs in a customers Azure Virtual Network (VNet). To date, the ASE has been based on the older Azure Cloud Services technology. This has limited the feature set in a number of ways. The ASE also has many networking dependencies that must be allowed in the customer VNet in order for the ASE to operate properly.

ASEv3 has several major changes in the system architecture. In ASEv3, the underlying technology is based on Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) instead of Cloud Services. This opens the door to a number of improvements including better load balancers, zone redundancy and multiple other things. Also in ASEv3, the ASE is deployed in a Microsoft managed VNet and then inbound/outbound application sockets are opened in the customer VNet.  This means that there isn't any ASE management traffic within the customer VNet, only application traffic.  If you were to look at the customer facing experience around the ASE dependencies, it is a lot cleaner.  There aren't any.

The way this is accomplished is by integrating the networking injection technologies with the single-tenant ASE.

The end result is a single tenant system that has no internet hosted dependencies in the customer network.  Customers can secure their workloads to their heart's content and Microsoft can secure the infrastructure in similar fashion.  

## Networking
The ASEv3 private preview functionality leverages private endpoints for inbound traffic while work on the load balancer progresses.  The desired GA system architecture will use an External Load Balancer (ELB) or an Internal Load Balancer (ILB) with the ASE to support inbound traffic.  The outbound traffic will be supported with a NAT Gateway.  That means that an ASE would be able to leverage ARM addresses for inbound and outbound.  

Until specified otherwise, you need to use two subnets for ASEv3.  One subnet will host the private endpoint used for inbound traffic to your ASE. The inbound subnet can be used for other things.  The outbound subnet is used for all outbound calls made from your ASE into your VNet. The outbound subnet should be of sufficient size to match the maximum amount of workers you might use in your ASE.  It is recommended to make your outbound subnet a /24 with 256 addresses to cover the current maximum of 200 ASP total instances. The outbound subnet must be delegated to Microsoft.Web/HostingEnvironments. 

### Required Network Security Groups and Route Tables
There are no required Network Security Groups (NSGs) or Route Tables (UDRs).  

### IP Addresses 
The IP address situation is different from previous ASE versions.  In ASEv3 private preview, there will be a default external address per size of worker and OS. That means there is a public address for small Windows workers, another for small Linux workers, another for medium Windows workers, etcâ€¦for a total of 6 possible outbound addresses.  The inbound address will be the private endpoint used for all traffic to your ASE, during preview. The private endpoint shows up as a resource in the customer subscription. If the customer deletes the private endpoint, they can no longer reach their ASE. There currently is no way to repair the ASE should a customer delete the private endpoint used with the ASE.  As a reminder, this is not the intended way to GA the feature.  There currently is no way to see the addresses being used with the ASE by default. 

## ASEv3 description
The system architecture to the ASE will evolve over time. In this initial release the ASEv3 instance will:

- Be multi-network
- Be built on VMSS
- Support non-blocking scaling of other SKU sizes. Example: If you are scaling a small windows ASP, it will block other small ASPs from scaling but would not block medium or large.
- Will support Windows and Linux apps
- Require two subnets, one for inbound and another for outbound
- Will not support some App Service features going through the customer VNet. Backup/restore, Key Vault references in app settings, using a private container registry, and Diagnostic logging to storage are some that will not work.  
- Will not have FTP
- Only available in East US 2.  Other regions will be added later.  

The preview bits will evolve and add:

- Ability to scale App Service plans up or down (not working yet)
- Ability to see the addresses used by your ASE (not yet available)
- Can be deployed on a host group 
- Automatically scaling infrastructure
- Ability to get a container from a private registry
- Ability for currently unsupported App Service features to go through customer VNet
- ILB and ELB for inbound traffic
- NAT Gateway support for outbound traffic
- Dv4 VMs used for workers instead of the dv2.  
- Improved portal support
- Command line support (AZ CLI and PowerShell)
- New pricing SKU and new pricing 
- Upgrade capability from ASEv2 to ASEv3
- FTP support

Coming later we will also add:

- Ability to use private endpoints and VNet Integration from an ASEv3 hosted apps
- Fast scaling (not anticipated yet before GA)
- Additional VM sizes
- Even distribution between availability zones

## Joining the private preview

If you want to join the private preview, please go to https://aka.ms/asev3-private-preview-signup and provide:

- Name 
- Email address
- Subscription to be used for the ASEv3

The allowlisting process can take a few days as it is a manual process

This blog can be reached at the link:  http://aka.ms/asev3-private-preview
As updates and changes are made, they will be noted in this article.

Participation will enroll your email address in the asev3preview@microsoft.com distribution list along with the engineering team and other private preview participants.

## Creating an ASEv3 

Private preview requirements

- Subscription must be allowlisted
- Must use hide key for portal support https://aka.ms/ASEv3Creation
- Users will pay the current ASEv2 rates
- Must provision a VNet in East US 2 before ASEv3 creation
- Must create 2 subnets.  One subnet must be delegated to Microsoft.Web/HostingEnvironments and should be a /24
- Need write access on the entire VNET

The Hosting tab allows you to pick the initial OS that the ASE will start with.  You can always add the other OS later. This matters to the type of workers that are initially provisioned.  
The host group option allows you to deploy on dedicated hardware. There is an added charge for the host group above and beyond the ASE rate.  This capability does not yet work but will in the next App Service update.

When configuring your Network, you can only use pre-existing networking resources. The ability to create the Vnet and subnets will be added in a later portal update. 
The outbound subnet must be delegated to Microsoft.Web/HostingEnvirionment and cannot be used for anything else.

ASEv3 creation isn't fast yet. It will still take a while as the resources are provisioned and configured.
