    The App Service Environment, with Isolated pricing plans, is now available in the US Government regions.  The App Service Environment is a deployment of the Azure App Service and runs in your Azure Virtual Network.  With an App Service Environment you have more options for:
    <ul>
     <li>
      High scale
     </li>
     <li>
      Network isolation
     </li>
     <li>
      High memory utilization
     </li>
    </ul>
    The App Service Environment can be deployed with an internet accessible endpoint or with an endpoint on a private address in your Azure Virtual Network.  This makes the App Service Environment a great solution to host your line of business applications or those applications that you want to only expose through a web application firewall such as the Azure Application Gateway.
