We are happy to announce that App Service now supports apps targeting **.NET 6 Preview 4** across all public regions and scenarios on both Windows and Linux App Service plans through ([App Service Early Access](https://aka.ms/app-service-early-access)).

Azure Functions has also added initial support for .NET 6 Preview.

This is the first time that a pre-release stack is publicly available in the platform ahead of GA release and it makes good on our promise to accelerate FX availability made during the [.NET 5 GA release announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/announcing-asp-net-core-in-net-5/#deploy-net-5-web-apps-to-azure-app-service-today).

Any app targeting the .NET 6 Early Access on App Service will be automatically updated to the latest .NET 6 Preview releases as they become available all the way op to RC and GA.
