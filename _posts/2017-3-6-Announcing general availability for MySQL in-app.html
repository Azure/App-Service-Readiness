<div id="content">MySQL in-app was a preview feature <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/mysql-in-app-preview-app-service/">launched last year </a>in August.  The feature primary objective was to make it easier to build and test MySQL based applications on App Service.  Today, I am excited to announce general availability of MySQL in-app feature.

<em>Note : This MySQL in-app is specific to Windows version of Azure app service. If you are looking for local mysql on Linux MySQL app service , click <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appserviceteam/2017/06/07/mysql-in-app-feature-for-web-apps-on-linux/">here.</a></em>

We have rolled out a <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appserviceteam/2017/03/06/migrate-development-database-on-mysql-in-app-to-production-mysql-database/">database migration feature </a>from MySQL in-app that allows you to export your database content from <strong>localdb</strong> database provided by MySQL in-app and import it into a production database. A <strong>production database</strong> can be managed MySQL service or your custom MySQL server solution.  See <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appserviceteam/2017/03/06/announcing-general-availability-for-mysql-in-app#productionmysql">options</a> for production MySQL database in Azure.

This feature will be continue to accelerate your development and testing scenarios . Here are key benefits of using this feature :
<ol>
<li>It supports any runtime stack that is available in App Service (Windows) applications such as Node JS , .NET , Python , PHP etc. For  Python, Node JS , .NET do make sure you have the appropriate libraries or drivers with your code in order to connect to MySQL database provided with MySQL in-app</li>
<li>It’s cost-effective since there’s no additional cost to use this feature and you only pay for the App Service plan (since resources are shared).</li>
<li>The MySQL and Web processes are co-located in the same environment (hence the term in-app) which means storage is shared.</li>
<li>Includes support for slow query logging and general logging, which you’ll need to turn on as needed (this feature impacts performance, so you shouldn’t use it all the time).</li>
<li>One click migration of your database from MySQL in-app to a production MySQL database solution. <span id="productionmysql">Azure offers many solutions for MySQL</span> , including:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/services/mysql">Azure database for MySQL(Preview)</a></li>
<li>Marketplace solutions for <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/?term=mysql">MySQL</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/?term=mariadb">MariaDB</a>, and other MySQL-compatible solutions from partners like <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partners/bitnami/mysql/">Bitnami</a>and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partners/mariadb/cluster-maxscale/">MariaDB</a></li>
<li>Community-contributed <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/templates/?term=mysql+cluster+centos+-lamp+-website">Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates</a>deploying on VMs</li>
<li>MySQL on virtual machine on <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-classic-mysql-on-opensuse/">Linux</a>or <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-classic-mysql-2008r2/">Windows</a> OS</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<div id="production">

If you intend to use this feature for PRODUCTION web application , your web application must meet one or more of the criteria below :
<ul>
<li>your application is read only web site [ when file server is in read only mode , the database is read only as well ]</li>
<li>your application does not need auto scale</li>
<li>File servers may go into read only mode from 1 to 6 mins depending on whether an upgrade is occurring or any intermittent storage connectivity issue occurs. For example if you use wordpress and during this time you cannot write a post or edit content. You can retry in a few minutes and it will work. If this is okay for your production app then use MySQL inapp</li>
<li>Review your user traffic on your application and test to see if your application can run on one instance. If it can manage the load , you can use MySQL inapp for production.</li>
</ul>
The reason for the criteria mentioned above is due to the lack of support for auto scale on App service with MySQL in-app.
