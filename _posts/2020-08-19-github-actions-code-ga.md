A year ago [we announced](https://azure.github.io/AppService/2019/08/10/Github-actions-for-webapps.html) a GitHub Action to deploy your web apps to Azure App Service. Then in April we added GitHub Actions as an option in the Deployment Center. We are excited to share that the GitHub Actions integration with Azure App Service is now Generally Available and ready for production workloads. 

> The current GitHub Actions option in the Portal does not yet support deploying Docker containers. You can still set up Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) with Docker containers and GitHub Actions. See this tutorial.

The Deployment Center helps you build a CI/CD pipeline on GitHub Actions. This saves time, and simplifies the process if you are new to GitHub Actions or CI/CD.

If you are new to App Service, see our [Zero to Hero series](https://azure.github.io/AppService/tags/#zero-to-hero) to learn about App Service and to go from zero to cloud hero! The articles cover CI/CD, deployment slots, certificates, domains, and even network security!
