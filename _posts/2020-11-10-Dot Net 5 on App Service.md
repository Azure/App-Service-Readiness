We are happy to announce that App Service now supports **.NET 5** applications across all public regions and scenarios on both Windows and Linux App Service plans.

The App Service and .NET teams worked closely together to deliver this functionality on the same day as .NET 5 reached GA ([see .NET 5 GA announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/announcing-asp-net-core-in-net-5/)). Going forward every new preview release of **.Net 6** and beyond will be available on App Service on DAY 0 of it's release.

This is a first for the App Service platform and was achieved through a new **Early Access** feature ([learn more about App Service Early Access](https://aka.ms/app-service-early-access)). App Service **Early Access** was developed in close cooperation with the .NET team and we are very excited to have .NET 5 GA release be the first runtime deliver through this feature.

While we are starting with [.NET 5 early access](https://github.com/Azure/app-service-linux-docs/blob/master/Runtime_Support/dot_net_core.md) we plan to use the **Early Access** mechanism to deliver faster and more frequent updates for all the App Service supported languages including Node and Python and others.

If you want to learn more, be sure to checkout our session during [.NET Conf 2020](https://www.dotnetconf.net/agenda) where we'll talk about how to modernize .NET Framework Apps, by migrating to App Service and 5 ways to get started with .NET 5 on App Service.
