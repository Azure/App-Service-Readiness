     <strong>
      Why should I ask questions here instead of StackOverflow or MSDN? Can I really ask anything?
     </strong>
    </h2>
    An AMA is a great place to ask us anything. StackOverflow and MSDN have restrictions on which questions can be asked. With an AMA, you’ll get answers directly from the team and have a conversation with the people who build these products and services.

Here are some question ideas:
    <ul>
     <li>
      What is App Service?
     </li>
     <li>
      What are the benefits of PaaS in comparison with IaaS?
     </li>
     <li>
      How do I manage access control to my resources?
     </li>
     <li>
      How many apps can I host on each App Service Plan?
     </li>
     <li>
      How do I monitor the health of the traffic to my apps?
     </li>
     <li>
      How do I solve issues that may happen with my app and its resources?
     </li>
     <li>
      How can I isolate the traffic to my app?
     </li>
     <li>
      How do I autoscale my app and how does affect billing?
     </li>
     <li>
      How is life in Seattle? Does it really rain all the time?
     </li>
    </ul>
    Go ahead, ask us anything about our public products or the team. Please note, we cannot comment on unreleased features and future plans and issues which require deep level debugging.

We're looking forward to having a conversation with you!
