We’re announcing that **Tinfoil Security** addon will no longer be available through **App Service**.

Over the next few months, we’ll start transitioning out this offer starting by disabling new sign ups at the end of **April 2020**.

Existing **Tinfoil** enabled apps can continue to use the existing addon until **May 2020**.

At any point during this transition period and through **September 2020** you can migrate your account along with all of your scan settings and history to **Tinfoil**  standalone service on [tinfoilsecurity.com](https://tinfoilsecurity.com).

By going through with this migration, you will get access to some features that were not available in the Azure integration at no additional cost including:

- More detailed scan reports such as an additional statistics page
- Access to **Tinfoil** API for easier automation
- The ability to add additional collaborators for read-only access to your **Tinfoil** scan results

Instructions for this migration will be sent out via email to existing customers, and will also appear on your **Tinfoil Security** addon dashboard.

**Tinfoil** is looking forward to continuing to help you keep your sites safe and secure!

If you have any question you can reach out to [Tinfoil support](mailto:support@tinfoilsecurity.com) .
