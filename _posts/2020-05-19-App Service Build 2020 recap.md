This year, [Microsoft Build](https://mybuild.microsoft.com/) is entirely online. Live and pre-recorded sessions are available for anyone to view. This article is a recap of the sessions from the App Service team, along with links to more information.

## Building and Managing .NET Core with App Service

*Building web apps with .NET Core? Check out the latest from the App Service team including how to build a continuous delivery pipeline using GitHub Actions, how to use Event Grid to subscribe and act on deployment events and how to monitor your production apps with Health Checks.*

**[Watch the session here](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2020/BOD126/player)**.

### GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a flexible automation framework that allows developers to (among other things) continuously deploy their applications to App Service.

- [Webapps deploy Action](https://github.com/Azure/webapps-deploy)
- [GitHub Actions for Azure](https://github.com/azure/actions)
- [GitHub Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions)

### App Service Health Checks

App Service Health Checks will automatically remove and restart unhealthy instances of your application when you are scaled out.

- [Documentation](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Health-Check-(Preview))

### Event Grid Integration

Event Grid is a high performance publish/subscribe messaging system. App Service now emits events that can be handled with Functions, Logic Apps, and more.

- [Getting started guide](https://azure.github.io/AppService/2020/05/11/event-grid-integration.html)
- [Event Grid overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/overview)
- [Comparison of Azure messaging services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/compare-messaging-services)

## Migrate Applications to Azure App Service

See how Azure is making it easy to quickly get your application running on App Service. Weâ€™ll show you how to use Migration Assistant for moving IIS sites and Linux containers to the cloud.

## FAQ

Many of you attended our "Ask the Experts" live session and sent us your questions. Here are some common questions you asked, along with their answers.

- **Can you use LetsEncrypt certificates with Azure App Services?** You're still able to use Let's Encrypt certs with App Service, however there is no official support when it comes to integrating it with auto-renew. We have [App Service Managed Certificates](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/secure-your-custom-domains-at-no-cost-with-app-service-managed-certificates-preview/), which is our free certificate offering that supports auto-renew. This feature is currently in preview and only currently supports CNAME Records. [Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/configure-ssl-certificate#create-a-free-certificate-preview).
- **What is the status for App Service Managed Certificates supporting apex/naked domains?** This is the next milestone for this feature that we are currently working on. We don't have an ETA to provide as of now. 
- **Is it a good strategy to use deployment slots to define environments (eg. myapp, myapp/uat, myapp/qa) or would it be better to have different resources for each environment? Would it affect the performance of the main prod "myapp" service?** You can certainly use slots to stage your test, QA, and other environments. This works especially well if your team uses the Gitflow branching strategy, as each branch can be [continuously deployed to a staging slot](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/deploy-best-practices#use-deployment-slots). If you are worried about the extra slots consuming too many resources, you can actually host the production slot on it's own, independent App Service Plan.
- **What is the status for the different logs with the Azure Monitor integration?** We will be releasing AppServiceAppLogs for Windows soon -- estimating the next two/three months. We don't have an ETA for the other logs as of now.
