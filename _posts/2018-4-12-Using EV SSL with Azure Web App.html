    You can use EV SSL with Azure web apps. There are many CA that provide EV SSL for your web applications and the two options you have to use EV SSL with azure web app :
    <ol>
    </ol>
    <h3>

    <h3>
     Troubleshooting Issues
    </h3>
    In the
    <a href="https://portal.azure.com">
     Azure portal
    </a>
    , go to your App Service Certificate using this Key Vault resource for your EV SSL certificate . Follow the steps below to troubleshoot issues :
    <ul>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Key Vault may have moved to another subscription or deleted or in a suspended state
      </strong>
      : In the portal , when you open your App Service certificate you will see the status "Key Vault out of Sync "  . In this case , click on the status tile which will prompt you to reconfigure your Key Vault to App Service certificate to a valid Key Vault . Note the Key Vault must be in the same subscription as the App Service certificate
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Key Vault secret was updated but I still see the old secret in App Service certificate :
      </strong>
      <span>
       Web App service runs a background job that periodically (once a day ) that syncs all App Service certificate. Hence when you rotate or update a certificate, s
      </span>
      <span>
       ometimes the application is still retrieving the old certificate and not the newly updated certificate.  This  is because the job has not run to sync the certificate resource.   To force a sync of the certificate , you can click on
      </span>
      <strong>
       Rekey and Sync
      </strong>
      <span>
       setting and then click on
      </span>
      <strong>
       Sync
      </strong>
      <span>
       button .
      </span>
