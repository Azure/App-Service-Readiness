    Have you tried bringing your code or bringing your container to App Service on Linux yet? App Service on Linux is a fully managed platform that allows you to quickly build, deploy, and globally scale your apps. You can bring your code to App Service on Linux and take advantage of the built-in images for popular supported language stacks, such as Node, Java, PHP, etc, or bring your Docker container to easily deploy to Web App for Containers. We have seen strong adoption since

     Linux on ASE GA Price Offering
    </strong>
    As some of you may know, we announced that
    <span>
     <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appserviceteam/2018/07/30/linuxasega/">
      Linux on App Service Environment (ASE) is now generally available
     </a>
    </span>
    . Because Linux on App Service Environment combines the features from App Service on Linux and App Service Environment, Linux customers will be able to take advantage of deploying Linux and containerized apps in an App Service Environment. This is ideal for deploying applications into an Azure Virtual Network for secure network access or apps running at a high scale.

    Linux on ASE saw healthy adoption during preview, and we‚Äôd like to encourage further adoption now that we‚Äôre in General Availability. Taking that into consideration, we‚Äôre extending the

    price (for Linux on ASE, which is the Linux Isolated App Service Plan SKU) for
    <em>
     a limited time
    </em>
    through GA!

Please note that when this limited time GA price offering ends, the final Linux on ASE price will be approximately twice the price of our Premium SKU. (Once the price offering ends, the prices will be closer to Windows on ASE.)

While the date for the GA price change is TBD, a 30-day notice will be given and announced
