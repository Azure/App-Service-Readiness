.NET 5 is the latest version update to expand the capabilities of .NET by taking the best of Core, Framework, Xamarin, and Mono to create a unified platform for improving developer scenarios.  The release of .NET 5 is currently in preview and available for you to use for upgrading existing or creating new applications.

Find more information on the release and how to upgrade an existing project see [here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-5-preview-1). 

If you would like to get started working with .NET 5 on App Service you can use two deployment methods to do so.  A Self-Contained deployment that will allow you to deploy your app on machines that don't have the runtime installed. 
You can also deploy your application with a more portable solution using a Container which will package your app and dependencies to run on App Service. 

Getting Started
In order to setup .NET 5 in your application you need to first install the [.NET 5.0 SDK]( https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0).  If you're on Windows using Visual Studio, you'll need to download the latest preview version (at least [16.6](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/)).

## Self-Contained Deployment
A Self-Contained deployment enables you to run .NET 5 because it doesn't rely on the presence of shared components on the target system and all components including Core libraries and runtime are with the application and isolated from other apps.  This way you have sole control of which version your application is running. Self-contained deployments are supported for both Windows and Linux apps.  Note that with self-contained applications you should be aware of large deployments and managing updates as this will take up more hard drive space and cause you to be responsible for supplying updated versions of your app with new security patches.  

To complete a self-contained deployment in .NET Core you would first create your project as usual then choose **ASP.NET Core 5.0** for your apps version after selecting your application template. Select **Create** and modify your application as needed.

When publishing, you simply **Right-Click** your project and select **publish**.  In the latest version of Visual Studio you can choose where your target publish is from a new menu.

Then select **Azure App Service (Windows)** or **Azure App Service (Linux)** depending on your preference on the following screen.

Next, Choose an existing App Service that you've already created or create one from Visual Studio with a new App Service and fill out the required information as you normally would when publishing.    

When you reach the publish screen click the pencil icon to edit your **Deployment Mode** for publishing your application.

Next, Choose the Deployment Mode option and make sure **Self-Contained** is chosen.

After you select the Self-Contained option your *Target Runtime* will auto-populate to linux-x64 or win-x86 depending on what you chose from the previous menu to publish to App Service (Windows) or App Service (Linux).
**Save** your new settings and click **Publish** on the preceding screen to publish to App Service and launch your application using .NET Core 5.

More information on self-contained deployment can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/).


## Container Deployment
The other option you have for running your .NET 5 application is to deploy a docker container to App Service on Linux or Windows (Premium SKU only).  When deploying a container you are packing the application and it's dependencies into a Linux or Windows based image to run on the App Service platform.  This enables your application to be more portable in nature as it isn't reliant on the host operating system and has the runtime and sdk added into the image via dockerfile.  

Once you have your application setup for .NET 5, the steps to deploy a containerized application would be the same as any other container deployment.  **Right-click** your project, **Add -> Docker Support** .  Your .NET Core project will have a new Dockerfile added with the .NET 5.0 base image and sdk templated and ready for you to publish.

After you've added docker support, you'll publish it to a registry, and create your App Service as usual.  If you need further detail in deploying a containerized application, see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-get-started-windows-container) for a more detailed tutorial.
