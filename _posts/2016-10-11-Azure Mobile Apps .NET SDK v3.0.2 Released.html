    Today, we released a patch version of the Azure Mobile Apps .NET SDK.  If you have already

     adjusted your clients to use v3.0.1
    </a>
    , then this update does not provide any benefit.  However, if you are upgrading from v2.x to get support for Android Nougat, you should use v3.0.2.  

Here are the improvements:
    <ul>
     <li>
      (

      ,
      <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-mobile-apps-net-client/issues/235" target="_blank">
       #235
      </a>
      ,
      <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-mobile-apps-net-client/issues/240" target="_blank">
       #240
      </a>
      ) The .NET SDK v3.0.1 required iOS and Android developers to create the offline database file prior to its use.  This is no longer a requirement.
     </li>
     <li>
      (

      ) The
      <code>
       SQLitePCL.Batteries.Init()
      </code>
      initialization code was called multiple times.  We also suggested that you call it yourself.  You no longer have to call it yourself, and it is only called once.
     </li>
     <li>
      (
      <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-mobile-apps-net-client/issues/231" target="_blank">

       #232
      </a>
      ) We have updated documentation.  The documentation now clarifies our supported platforms, and the HOWTO includes the new instructions for working with offline data.
     </li>
    </ul>
    In addition, we've updated the quick start projects that you can download from the Azure portal to use the new SDK.
