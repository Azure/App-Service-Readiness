<sup>1</sup> - Both PHP v5.6 and v7.0 are past [End-Of-Life](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php), and are no longer receiving security updates from the community.  However, to ensure our customers have the most secure PHP builds available, we have arranged to have relevant security fixes from supported versions of PHP backported to PHP v5.6 and v7.0.
