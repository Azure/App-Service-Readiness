     <strong>
      Why should I ask questions here instead of StackOverflow or MSDN? Can I really ask anything?
     </strong>
    </h2>
    An AMA is a great place to ask us anything. StackOverflow and MSDN have restrictions on which questions can be asked. With an AMA, you’ll get answers directly from the team and have a conversation with the people who build these products and services.

Here are some question ideas:
    <ul>
     <li>
      What is Serverless? What is Functions?
     </li>
     <li>
      What are the benefits of Serverless in comparison with IaaS?
     </li>
     <li>
      How do I manage access control to my resources?
     </li>
     <li>
      How many functions should I host in each Function app?
     </li>
     <li>
      How do I monitor the health of my functions?
     </li>
     <li>
      How do I diagnose issues that I suspect are happening with my functions' health?
     </li>
     <li>
      What is the Azure Functions Premium plan?
     </li>
     <li>
      When to choose between Durable Functions and Logic Apps? Between Functions and Logic Apps?
     </li>
     <li>
      Does Serverless really mean the lack or Servers? What is this madness??
     </li>
    </ul>
    Go ahead, ask us anything about our public products or the team. Please note, we cannot comment on unreleased features and future plans and issues which require deep level debugging.

We're looking forward to having a conversation with you!
