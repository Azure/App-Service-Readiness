    We are excited to bring you the latest release of our
    <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-mobile-apps-ios-client/releases/tag/3.2.0">
     Mobile Apps iOS client SDK 3.2.0
    </a>
    (
    <a href="http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/MicrosoftAzureMobile/3.2.0/">
     CocoaPods
    </a>
    ). There are a few updates in this release:
    <ol>
     <li>
      We extended support for Refresh
      <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/mobile-apps-easy-authentication-refresh-token-support/">
      </a>
      Token for all of our iOS customers. This feature was previously only captured in our
      <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Client">
       Managed SDK 2.1.0
      </a>
      and later versions to enable a smoother development experience around identity provider token expiry. For more information on this feature, see the
      <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/mobile-apps-easy-authentication-refresh-token-support/">
       Refreshing User Logins in App Service Mobile Apps
      </a>
      blog post.
     </li>
     <li>
      We added support for the latest iOS environments
      <a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/">
       iOS 10
      </a>
      . It also works with
      <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">
       Xcode 8.1
      </a>
      and
      <a href="https://swift.org/">
       Swift 3
      </a>
      .
     </li>
     <li>
      We optimized network performance by reusing NSURLSession objects. This is particularly apparent in long-running async operations like data pulls. (Shout out to
      <a href="https://github.com/damienpontifex">
       Damien Pontifex
      </a>
      for his continuous support in helping to improve our iOS SDK through open source contributions).
     </li>
    </ol>
    The latest
    <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-ios-get-started/">
     Mobile Apps iOS Quickstart
    </a>
    is also available and compatible with this release of the iOS SDK.
