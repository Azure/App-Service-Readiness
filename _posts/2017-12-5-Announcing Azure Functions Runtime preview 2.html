    Customers have embraced
    <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/">
     Azure Functions
    </a>
    because it allows them to focus on application innovation rather than infrastructure management. The simplicity of the Functions programming model that underpins the service, has been key to enable this. This model that allows developers to build event-driven solutions and easily bind their code to other services while using their favorite developer tools, has good utility even outside the cloud.

Today we are excited to announce the second preview of Azure Functions Runtime, building on the first preview and feedback from customers, which brings the simplicity and power of Azure Functions to on-premises.
    <h2>
     Azure Functions Runtime Recap
    </h2>
    The Azure Functions Runtime provides a method for customers to take advantage of the Functions Programming model on-premises within their own organization or datacenter.

Offering a consistent development experience with the public cloud service, customers can use the Functions portal or Visual Studio to develop and publish Function Applications on-premises.

This also enables customers to experience Functions-as-a-Service before committing to the cloud and also enabling customers to easily translate their code assets to the cloud when they move.

Azure Functions Runtime consists of two pieces, the Management Role and the Worker Role.  As the names suggest, these two are for managing and executing functions code respectively. You can scale out your Functions by installing the Worker Role on multiple machines and take advantage of spare computing power.

­What’s New?

This release brings further improvements and features to our on-premises audience:
    <ul>
     <li>
      Support for Azure Functions runtime 2.0, known limitations of the v2.0 runtime are available at

       this link
      </a>
      . This enables you to write functions in C# (.NET Standard) or JavaScript
     </li>
     <li>
      Hosting of v2 Functions on Windows Nano containers, providing a streamlined, lightweight experience.

    <h3>
     Looking Forward
    </h3>
    We are continuing to shape the direction of our on-premises offering of Azure Functions, based on customer feedback during preview.  We are interested in hearing your feedback and use cases as we move towards a GA Release.  We’re excited to see the types of applications you are building and the types of workloads you envisage running in Azure Functions Runtime.
