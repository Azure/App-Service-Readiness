In this article I will walk you through setting up a secure resilient Web App using some new features that have just been release or are very close to release. Below is the target setup. One or more Web Apps in multiple regions with Azure AD authentication and custom domain. Azure Front Door (AFD) will provide global load balancing and Web Application Firewall (WAF) capabilities, and the Web Apps will be isolated to only receive traffic from the specific AFD instance.

Most of the setup you can complete using the Azure portal, but there are some preview features that require scripting. I will be using Azure CLI throughout the walk-trough, however Azure PowerShell or Azure Resource Manager templates will be just as fine. I am using bash though WSL to run the commands. If you are using a PowerShell or Cmd prompt, small syntax tweaks may be needed.

![Final setup]({{site.baseurl}}/media/2021/03/secureapp-final-setup.png){: .align-center}

We will set this up in five steps + a bonus step with more advanced scenarios:

1. Basic Web App with Azure AD Authentication
2. Add Azure Front Door
3. Add Custom Domain and Certificate
4. Restrict traffic to Web App from AFD
5. Increase resiliency with multiple geo-distributed Web Apps

At the end, there is a section on alternative approaches and advanced scenarios and we finish off with a FAQ section.

## 1. Basic Web App with Azure AD Authentication

![Step 1]({{site.baseurl}}/media/2021/03/secureapp-step1.png){: .align-center}

First we will setup a Resource Group and a Web App with Azure AD Authentication. Choose a unique name for your Web App and feel free to change name of the resource group and location. If you have preferences for App Service Plan or other options, you can configure this as well.

```bash
az group create -n securewebsetup -l westeurope
az appservice plan create -g securewebsetup -n securewebplan --sku B1
az webapp create -g securewebsetup -p securewebplan -n securewebapp2021 # Web App name must be globally unique
```

and since the focus is security, we only allow HTTPS:

```bash
az webapp update -g securewebsetup -n securewebapp2021 --https-only
```

### Debug page
To help debug the application, you can create a file called default.cshtml with the following content

```html
@using System.Web.Configuration
@using System.Net;

<body style="background-color: #00E60A;">
@{
	var pubIp =  new System.Net.WebClient().DownloadString("https://api.ipify.org");
}
  <h3>Debug information</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Request Url</strong><span>: @Request.Url</span></li>
    <li><strong>Outbound public IP</strong><span>: @pubIp</span></li>
    <li><strong>Inbound client IP</strong><span>: @Request.ServerVariables["REMOTE_ADDR"]</span></li>
  </ul>
  <strong>Headers</strong>
  <ul>    
      @foreach (var h in Request.Headers)
          {<li><strong>@h</strong><span>: @Request.Headers[h.ToString()]</span></li>}
  </ul>
</body>
```

Zip the file and push it to the Web App. Afterwards you should see a site with a green background and some Debug information:

```bash
zip -r default.zip default.cshtml
az webapp deployment source config-zip -g securewebsetup -n securewebapp2021 --src ./default.zip
```

![Debug Page]({{site.baseurl}}/media/2021/03/debug-page.png){: .align-center}

### Authentication setup

App Service provides an easy way to setup authentication. The feature is sometimes referred to as Easy Auth. There is a new version of this in preview and for this setup we will need some of the new options that v2 provides. The new Authentication feature is available in the Azure portal, but since we need some advanced configuration options that are not yet exposed in the portal, we might as well open up the hood now.
You have to construct the resource path to the Web App. It was returned when you created it in the previous steps, and you can also find it in the address bar when you open the resource in the portal.

Ensure that you can read the settings first. Pay attention to the api-version. You should see a lot of json returned:

```bash
az rest --uri /subscriptions/REPLACE-ME-SUBSCRIPTIONID/resourceGroups/REPLACE-ME-RESOURCEGROUP/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/REPLACE-ME-APPNAME?api-version=2020-09-01 --method get
```

All the settings of Authentication is defined in a [json structure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-authentication-how-to#configuration-file-reference). There are many options to fine tune the configuration, but below is an extraction of the required settings we need for this scenario. Copy this into a file called auth.json:

```json
{
    "properties": {
        "platform": {
            "enabled": true
        },
        "globalValidation": {
            "unauthenticatedClientAction": "RedirectToLoginPage",
            "redirectToProvider": "azureActiveDirectory"
        },
        "httpSettings": {
            "requireHttps": true
        },
        "login": {
            "preserveUrlFragmentsForLogins": true,
            "allowedExternalRedirectUrls": [
                "https://easyauth.callback",
                "https://REPLACE-ME-WEBAPP-NAME.azurewebsites.net/"
            ]
        },
        "identityProviders": {
            "azureActiveDirectory": {
                "enabled": true,
                "registration": {
                    "openIdIssuer": "https://sts.windows.net/REPLACE-ME-TENANTID/v2.0",
                    "clientId": "REPLACE-ME-APPID",
                    "clientSecretSettingName": "REPLACE-ME-SECRETNAME"
                },
                "validation": {
                    "allowedAudiences": [
                        "https://REPLACE-ME-WEBAPP-NAME.azurewebsites.net"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The file has some placeholders that you need to fill in with your own values. You will generate these values in the next few steps. The first REPLACE-ME-WEBAPP-NAME (2 occurrences) you already have. This should be replaced with the name of your Web App. In my case securewebapp2021.

REPLACE-ME-TENANTID you can find by running ```az account show``` in the homeTenantId property.

Next we need to create an App registration in Azure AD. This is a way to tell Azure AD, that this Web App is allowed to authenticate users in the directory and that it can do so only using specific urls. Display name can be anything. The reply-url is your base url combined with a special callback path: https://securewebapp2021.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/aad/callback

```bash
az ad app create --display-name securewebapp2021 --reply-urls https://securewebapp2021.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/aad/callback
```

Replace REPLACE-ME-APPID with the the appId from the returned output.

For the last placeholder REPLACE-ME-SECRETNAME, this will be the name of an App Setting in your Web App that contains the secret. The App Setting can [reference a Key Vault secret](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references) if you prefer. You can pick any name. I will choose AAD_CLIENT_SECRET. To add the secret, run the following command (with the AppId from the previous step). If you leave out the password parameter, it will auto-generate a complex password:

```bash
az ad app credential reset --id REPLACE-ME-APPID --password "reP!@ce-w!th.VeRys3cr3tC0d!"
```

Add the value of the generated password to the App Settings of the Web App:

```bash
az webapp config appsettings set -g securewebsetup -n securewebapp2021 --settings "AAD_CLIENT_SECRET=reP!@ce-w!th.VeRys3cr3tC0d!"
```

Finally, let's update the Web App with the Authentication configuration (make sure you save your auth.json file):

```bash
az rest --uri /subscriptions/REPLACE-ME-SUBSCRIPTIONID/resourceGroups/REPLACE-ME-RESOURCEGROUP/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/REPLACE-ME-APPNAME/config/authsettingsV2?api-version=2020-09-01 --method put --body @auth.json 
```

If you browse to the site now, you should be redirected to consent to the App permissions and login to your Azure AD tenant. If you deployed the debug site, you will notice some extra headers prefixed with X-MS-CLIENT-PRINCIPAL.

## 2. Add Azure Front Door

[Azure Front Door](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/standard-premium/overview) is a global, scalable entry-point that uses the Microsoft global edge network to create fast, secure, and widely scalable web applications. With Front Door, you can transform your global consumer and enterprise applications into robust, high-performing personalized modern applications with contents that reach a global audience through Azure.

Azure Front Door announced in February the next generation in public preview. It combines the existing features with integrated CDN and WAF capabilities as well as some new advanced options to use private endpoints as origin (backend) and onboard Managed Certificates using TXT records, which can be helpful in a migration scenario. We will be using the preview version. PowerShell and CLI support is being worked on, so we will use the portal for now.

![Step 2]({{site.baseurl}}/media/2021/03/secureapp-step2.png){: .align-center}

Create a new resource, search for Front Door and select "Front Door Standard/Premium (Preview)"

![Azure Front Door Standard/Premium]({{site.baseurl}}/media/2021/03/frontdoor-new.png){: .align-center}

Use the Quick Create and under Basics, use the existing resource group. Give it a name and endpoint name, and select your App Service Web App. If you want to try out the private endpoint feature or WAF capabilities later, you should select the [Premium tier](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/standard-premium/tier-comparison). Once it is created, it typically takes 5-10 minutes to replicate globally. Go grab a coffee and come back.

![Azure Front Door Basics]({{site.baseurl}}/media/2021/03/frontdoor-basics.png){: .align-center}

### Alter authentication settings

After a good coffee, try to browse to the Front Door url. In my case: https://secureweb.z01.azurefd.net. I appears to be working, but notice the address bar. It redirected you directly back to your Web App. To fix that we need to update the App registration in Azure AD to allow authentication request coming from the new url. You can add multiple reply-urls by separating them with a space, but if you only want to allow authentication through Front Door, you can just replace it.

```bash
az ad app update --id REPLACE-ME-APPID --reply-urls https://secureweb.z01.azurefd.net/.auth/login/aad/callback https://securewebapp2021.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/aad/callback
```

We also need one of the new features of Authentication in App Service. Open up the auth.json file again and in the login section under allowedExternalRedirectUrls add the Azure Front Door url. You should also add it in the AAD validation section under allowedAudiences (remember the comma in both settings). Finally we need to tell the Authentication framework where to look for the original address. In forward proxies like Front Door, the address is typically sent in an http header called X-Forwarded-Host. If you are working with Azure Application Gateway, the header will be called X-Original-Host. The forwardProxy section goes to httpSettings. Final json file looks like this:

```json
{
    "properties": {
        "platform": {
            "enabled": true
        },
        "globalValidation": {
            "unauthenticatedClientAction": "RedirectToLoginPage",
            "redirectToProvider": "azureActiveDirectory"
        },
        "httpSettings": {
            "requireHttps": true,
            "forwardProxy": {
                "convention": "Custom",
                "customHostHeaderName": "X-Forwarded-Host"
            }
        },
        "login": {
            "preserveUrlFragmentsForLogins": true,
            "allowedExternalRedirectUrls": [
                "https://easyauth.callback",
                "https://securewebapp2021.azurewebsites.net",
                "https://secureweb.z01.azurefd.net"
            ]
        },
        "identityProviders": {
            "azureActiveDirectory": {
                "enabled": true,
                "registration": {
                    "openIdIssuer": "https://sts.windows.net/REPLACE-ME-TENANTID/v2.0",
                    "clientId": "REPLACE-ME-APPID",
                    "clientSecretSettingName": "AAD_CLIENT_SECRET"
                },
                "validation": {
                    "allowedAudiences": [
                        "https://securewebapp2021.azurewebsites.net",
                        "https://secureweb.z01.azurefd.net"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Save the file and run the ```az rest``` command again to update the settings:

```bash
az rest --uri /subscriptions/REPLACE-ME-SUBSCRIPTIONID/resourceGroups/REPLACE-ME-RESOURCEGROUP/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/REPLACE-ME-APPNAME/config/authsettingsV2?api-version=2020-09-01 --method put --body @auth.json 
```

You should now be able to access the Web App through Front Door and be authenticated. If you added the debug page, you should now see a few additional headers. One being X-Forwarded-Host that contains the url of the Front Door and X-Azure-FDID which contains the unique ID of your Front Door instance (make a note of this as we will be using it in step 4).

## 3. (Optional) Add Custom Domain and Certificate

![Step 3]({{site.baseurl}}/media/2021/03/secureapp-step3.png){: .align-center}

With Azure Front Door it is easy to add a custom domain and certificate. If you do not already have a custom domain, you can purchase one from Azure App Service Domains. For this demo, I will be using a domain called reddoglabs.com purchased through App Service Domains and I will be using Azure DNS to host the public DNS records. But any domain registrar and public DNS provider can be used. If you are using an Azure DNS Zone in the same subscription, you can even have Front Door add the needed records.

For certificate, you can bring your own certificate or you can use the Managed Certificate option. With the latter, Front Door will take care of enrolling and renewing the certificate - I like that so I do not forget to update my certificate when it expires.

My DNS is in another subscription, so I will have to add it myself, but it will also explicitly show the steps needed.

![Azure Front Door Custom Domain]({{site.baseurl}}/media/2021/03/frontdoor-customdomain.png){: .align-center}

After you added the domain, you need to prove that you own it. The new Front Door gives you a nice overview of the steps needed.

![Azure Front Door Validate Domain]({{site.baseurl}}/media/2021/03/frontdoor-domainvalidation.png){: .align-center}

When clicking the Pending link in the Validation state column, you will get instruction for adding a TXT record to validate your domain ownership.

![Azure DNS Add TXT Record]({{site.baseurl}}/media/2021/03/dns-addtxtrecord.png){: .align-center}

Time for another cup of coffee. The validation of the TXT record and the replication of the settings can take 5-10 minutes again. While you are waiting you can also modify the App registration and the auth.json file by adding the custom domain in the same sections mentioned in Step 2 under Alter authentication settings.

Final steps are to go back to the Domains overview in Front Door and associate the custom domain with the endpoint:

![Azure Front Door Associate Endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/media/2021/03/frontdoor-associateendpoint.png){: .align-center}

And to add a CNAME DNS record to map the actual domain:

![Azure DNS Add CNAME Record]({{site.baseurl}}/media/2021/03/dns-addcnamerecord.png){: .align-center}

Allow another 5-10 minutes to replicate the settings globally, and you should now be able to access an authenticated Web App through Front Door using a custom domain and certificate.

## 4. Restrict traffic to Web App from AFD

![Step 4]({{site.baseurl}}/media/2021/03/secureapp-step4.png){: .align-center}

We are still able to access the Web App directly, and in this step we will restrict access to the Web App, so traffic will only be allowed through Front Door. To do this we will be using some new features of access restrictions in App Service to create rules based on Service Tags and filter by http headers. Azure CLI support for the new features are still under construction, but since you are familiar with using REST calls by now, we can revert to that.

Create a json file named restrictions.json with the the following content and replace the placeholder with the specific Front Door ID found in step 2. It is also visible in the Overview section of the Front Door instance in Azure portal:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "ipSecurityRestrictions": [
      {
        "action": "Allow",
        "ipAddress": "AzureFrontDoor.Backend",
        "tag": "ServiceTag",
        "priority": 100,
        "headers": {
          "X-Azure-FDID": [
            "REPLACE-ME-FRONTDOORID"
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

After you added the Front Door ID in the json file, run the script to deploy the restriction (notice the change in the URI; web instead of authsettingsV2):

```bash
az rest --uri /subscriptions/REPLACE-ME-SUBSCRIPTIONID/resourceGroups/REPLACE-ME-RESOURCEGROUP/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/REPLACE-ME-APPNAME/config/web?api-version=2020-09-01 --method put --body @restrictions.json 
```

Now, if you access the site directly, you should immediately see the blue 403 - Forbidden error.

## 5. Increase resiliency with multiple geo-distributed Web Apps

![Step 5]({{site.baseurl}}/media/2021/03/secureapp-final-setup.png){: .align-center}

To improve resiliency of your App and protect against regional outages you can deploy your app to multiple regions. Let's add an instance in West US. We can reuse most of the scripts, but of course need to change the name in all lines. Since we are blocking access to the Web App directly, you can either remove or ignore the direct Web App url reference in auth.json. To make it easier to notice which site is accessed, you can change the background color of the alternative site by changing the last to digits of the body background-color to FF (light blue):

```bash
az appservice plan create -g securewebsetup -n securewebplan-westus --sku B1 --location westus
az webapp create -g securewebsetup -p securewebplan-westus -n securewebapp2021-westus
az webapp update -g securewebsetup -n securewebapp2021-westus --https-only

zip -r default-alt.zip default.cshtml
az webapp deployment source config-zip -g securewebsetup -n securewebapp2021-westus --src ./default-alt.zip

az webapp config appsettings set -g securewebsetup -n securewebapp2021-westus --settings "AAD_CLIENT_SECRET=reP!@ce-w!th.VeRys3cr3tC0d!"

az rest --uri /subscriptions/REPLACE-ME-SUBSCRIPTIONID/resourceGroups/REPLACE-ME-RESOURCEGROUP/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/REPLACE-ME-WESTUS-APPNAME/config/authsettingsV2?api-version=2020-09-01 --method put --body @auth.json 

az rest --uri /subscriptions/REPLACE-ME-SUBSCRIPTIONID/resourceGroups/REPLACE-ME-RESOURCEGROUP/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/REPLACE-ME-WESTUS-APPNAME/config/web?api-version=2020-09-01 --method put --body @restrictions.json 
```

After the Web App is configured, open the Front Door instance in Azure portal and add the new Web App as origin (backend) in the current origin group and update it:

![Azure Front Door Update Origin Group]({{site.baseurl}}/media/2021/03/frontdoor-updateorigingroup.png){: .align-center}

Front Door default load balancing behavior is to round robin traffic between the fastest and the next fastest origins within the configured latency sensitivity, but you can modify that. If you refresh enough times, you should be seeing the page change color (and the Request url in the debug page change).

## Alternative approaches and advanced scenarios

In this section, I will discuss some alternative approaches and advanced scenarios.

### Application Gateway

Instead of Front Door or in addition to Front Door you can use Azure Application Gateway to add WAF capabilities and advanced routing and rewrite logic. It can also be used to provide regional load balancing. Application Gateway currently does not support Manage Certificate, so you will have to bring your own certificate. For the Authentication in they auth.json, you will have to specify X-Original-Host as the customHostHeaderName. The rest of the settings and steps should be identical.

### Private endpoint

To secure the incoming traffic to the Web App(s) we used access restrictions. If you prefer private endpoint, this is also possible. The next generation Azure Front Door supports setting up a private endpoint from your Front Door instance directly to your Web App. For App Service, private endpoint requires Premium tier, so you need to scale up the App Service Plan. Besides that, the only change will be setup of origin in Front Door, where you can request the creation of a private endpoint, and then from the Web App(s) you can approve it.
The step of uploading the debug page will require some additional setup. The SCM site will also be available only through private endpoint, and you will have to run the script from within a network with line-of-sight and proper DNS resolution for the private endpoint.

### Custom domain for SCM Site

While not directly related to the Authentication part, you may want/need to expose the SCM site through a proxy if you want access through a custom domain or if you want to expose a private endpoint enabled site externally. [A post on how to do that](https://azure.github.io/AppService/2021/03/03/Custom-domain-for-scm-site.html) was recently published.

### Custom health probe path

If you have a custom health probe path, you can tell App Service to allow unauthenticated traffic on that specific path. Specify the relative path using an App Setting called WEBSITE_WARMUP_PATH.

```bash
az webapp config appsettings set -g securewebsetup -n securewebapp2021 --settings "WEBSITE_WARMUP_PATH=/default.cshtml"
```
