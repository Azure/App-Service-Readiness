       If your App Service is hosted on a public scale unit then you can only install certificates in
       <strong>
        CurrentUser Personal Store
       </strong>
       certificate.
      </span>
     </li>
     <li>
      <span>
       If your web app is hosted on an App Service Environments,
       <strong>
        CurrentUser or LocalMachine-Personal certificate
       </strong>
       store is only supported.
      </span>
     </li>
     <li>
      When using Deployment slots with your application  , keep in mind that the certificates are not sticky and will also get swapped  when you perform a slot swap operation.  Either user your application code to check for multiple public certificates or make sure the correct certificate is upload for slot as well before you swap a slot with production app.
