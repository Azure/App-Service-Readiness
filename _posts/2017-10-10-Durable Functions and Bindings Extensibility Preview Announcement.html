    We’re excited to announce two new preview features in Azure Functions:
    <ul>
     <li>
      Durable Functions: A framework that makes it easy to orchestrate multiple functions and manage state for your
      <a href="http://azure.com/serverless">
       serverless apps
      </a>
      .
     </li>
     <li>
      Binding extensibility: A capability that allows you to create your own reusable serverless components that can be used from any supported language.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="durable-functions">
     Durable Functions
    </h2>
    In serverless functions, as with many application frameworks, it’s commonly recommended to write your code to be stateless, and this is the best practice. What is often not discussed in detail, though, is how one should manage that state. For trivial scenarios like just standard user data, databases are an obvious option, or for messaging between applications, a queue service is sufficient. However, what if your application has need for a more complex, stateful orchestration of multiple components? Without better tools, you’re left to figure out the right way to combine those pieces. This is the problem that the Durable Functions feature seeks to solve; letting developers abstract away the management of state for complex, stateful orchestration. Today, we’re happy to announce that Durable Functions is now in preview.

Durable Functions builds on the
    <a href="https://github.com/Azure/durabletask">
     Durable Task Framework
    </a>
    , which was designed to allow developers to write code based orchestrations using async/await pattern in C#. This enabled the following:
    <ul>
     <li>
      Expression of tasks in simple C# code
     </li>
     <li>
      Automatic persistence and check-pointing of program state
     </li>
     <li>
      Versioning of orchestrations and activities
     </li>
     <li>
      Async timers, orchestration composition
     </li>
    </ul>
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable-functions-overview">
     With Durable Functions
    </a>
    , we let you write orchestrators and activities as Functions. Orchestrators can call Activity Functions, other sub-orchestrations, and wait for an external event. Combined, this functionality allows a lot of complex patterns to be expressed via code. For instance, the code below will fan out and call various Activity Functions, wait for them all to complete, and then allow you to sum the results (fan in). This pattern was possible before but involved a lot more setup and management code that was unrelated to the business logic.
    <pre><code class="lang-csharp">
#r "Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.DurableTask"

public static async Task&lt;long&gt; Run(DurableOrchestrationContext backupContext)
{
    string rootDirectory = backupContext.GetInput&lt;string&gt;();
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(rootDirectory))
    {
        rootDirectory = Environment.CurrentDirectory;
    }

    string[] files = await backupContext.CallFunctionAsync&lt;string[]&gt;(
        "E2_GetFileList",
        rootDirectory);

    var tasks = new Task&lt;long&gt;[files.Length];
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; files.Length; i++)
    {
<strong>            tasks[i] = backupContext.CallFunctionAsync&lt;long&gt;(
            "E2_CopyFileToBlob",
            files[i]);</strong>
    }

    <strong>await Task.WhenAll(tasks);</strong>

    long totalBytes = tasks.Sum(t =&gt; t.Result);
    return totalBytes;
}
</code></pre>
    In the above code, you can see the first set of bold code fanning out and calling many Functions, and then the later bold line waiting for them all to complete.

    <h2 id="binding-extensibility-goodbye-sdks-hello-bindings">
     Binding extensibility: goodbye SDKs, hello bindings
    </h2>
    Developers are building increasingly complex serverless applications and need better mechanisms for code reuse.
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-triggers-bindings">
     Triggers and bindings
    </a>
    allow developers to focus on their code and let Azure Functions handle all the logistics of connecting to other services, in a way “reusing” the glue code that we have already written for you. We are now providing a mechanism using which you can author your own custom bindings for Azure Functions, providing more avenues for reuse.  This mechanism (binding extensibility) is a feature of the
    <a href="https://aka.ms/func-xplat">
     2.0 Functions runtime
    </a>
    . In fact, Durable Functions is authored as a custom binding for Azure Functions.

Bindings allow you to create reusable serverless components that can be used from any supported language. If you host a developer service, bindings will make it easy for Functions developers to use your product. Developers can also create reusable packages and host them in a central repository, just like a library or SDK.

Binding extensibility allows you to provide a declarative interface for an SDK. For instance, we have a sample
    <a href="https://github.com/lindydonna/SlackOutputBinding">
     Slack output binding
    </a>
    that sends a slack message when a customer uses a
    <code>
     [Slack]
    </code>
    attribute (or the equivalent in function.json):

C#
    <pre><code class="lang-csharp">using System.Net;
using System.Net.Http;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host;
using SampleExtension;

namespace SampleFunctionApp
{
    public static class HttpTriggerSlack
    {
        [FunctionName("HttpTriggerSlack")]
        public static string Run(
            [HttpTrigger] SlackMessage message, 
            [Slack(WebHookUrl = "SlackWebHook")] out SlackMessage slackMessage,
            TraceWriter log)
        {
            slackMessage = message;

            return "Ok";
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
    JavaScript
    <pre><code class="lang-javascript">module.exports = function (context, req) {
    context.log('JS HTTP function processed a request: ' + req.body.text);

    context.bindings.slackMessage = req.body;
    context.done();
};
</code></pre>
