App Service has a suite of networking features that enable teams to fulfill their security requirements. Teams that must meet the most stringent security requirements can use an [App Service Environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/environment/intro), a fully isolated and dedicated hosting option that can be deployed with or without an external IP address.
