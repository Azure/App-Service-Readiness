<h2>Best practices for mission critical apps on Azure App Service</h2>
<span style="color: #000000;font-family: wf_segoe-ui_normal, 'Segoe UI', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size: 15px;font-style: normal;font-weight: 400;letter-spacing: normal;text-align: start;text-indent: 0px;background-color: #ffffff;float: none">Azure App Service provides 99.95% SLA even for apps running on only a single instance. However, there are steps you should take as a developer to insulate your customers from perceived cold start latencies incurred when deploying a new version of an app. This session walks through using a combination of multi-phase deployment slots (swap with preview), local cache for disk resiliency, application initialization for warmup, and proper app service plan configuration to minimize cold start performance hits.</span>

<h2>What is new in Azure App Service networking</h2>
<span style="color: #000000;font-family: wf_segoe-ui_normal, 'Segoe UI', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size: 15px;font-style: normal;font-weight: 400;letter-spacing: normal;text-align: start;text-indent: 0px;background-color: #ffffff;float: none">The Azure App Service has had multiple features to enable application isolation and virtual network access. Some of these capabilities required the use of an App Service Environment (ASE). New features have been developed to enable numerous use cases without the use of an ASE such as hosting line-of-business applications, accessing resources across ExpressRoute and also accessing resources that are secured with service endpoints. At the same time we are also making major improvements to the ASE and are enabling greater isolation than previously.</span>
