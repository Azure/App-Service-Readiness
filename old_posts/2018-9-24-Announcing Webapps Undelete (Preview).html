Today we are announcing the public preview release of Azure App Service Undelete. Undelete is available for all App Service Plans, from Basic and up. Only sites deleted in the past 30 days can be restored.

A user can undelete a deleted web app, and restore the following:

<li>The configuration of the app (the commands allows to skip the restoration of the app configuration).</li>
<li>The undelete commands will also to restore the *.azurewebsites.net host name if still available.</li>
</ul>
