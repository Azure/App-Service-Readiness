<div id="content">The App Service team is delighted to announce a revised scaling experience between Basic, Standard, and Premium App Service plans that will make it easier for customers to scale up to more performant VMs at the same price point.

Central to this announcement is a 20% price reduction for Pv2 App Service plans.

This change makes the P1v2 App Service plan the same price as the current S2 App Service plan, making it possible for customers to scale directly from S2 to P1v2. Giving them a more performant <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/series/">Dv2</a> based instance with 2X memory and an SSD drive at the same price as the S2 offering.

With the 20% Premium V2 price reduction we also have a new scaling experience which highlights the ability to move directly from S2 to P1v2. Pricing tiers are now grouped by their target workload into Dev/Test, Production, and Isolated with recommended scale guidance provided.
<ul>
<li>Dev/Test includes the Free, Shared and Basic App Service plan options</li>
<li>Production includes Standard, Premium and Premium v2</li>
<li>Isolated includes the scale options for App Service plans hosted in an App Service environment.</li>
</ul>
